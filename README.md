# communer
 Communer is a community based social networking web app. You can become a member of the platform by registering. Once you register you will be able to login to your account. You can then search for communities and become a part of the communities which you want. Once you become a part of the community, you will be able to add post to the communities which can be text, image or a video. All the communities are public meaning that anyone can see the posts in the community provided that he see has the url to the community which can be obtained by search communities option. 

Key Features:
While the text part of the post is stored in the database, the image and video files are uploaded to the server using a unique name which is then stored to the database and retrived later when the post is to be viewed.
 This project uses Node.js and express for backend and MongoDB as the database to store the information.
